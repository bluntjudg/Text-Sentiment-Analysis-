Text Classification Project 
# Overview 
This project aims to build a machine learning model to classify text data into predefined categories. The project involves data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation. The following instructions will guide you through setting up the project, understanding the code structure, and running the necessary scripts.

This project is an intgration of new package called NeatText, a Python library that offers text preprocessing functions for cleaning and normalizing text data. It provides various text cleaning operations to remove noise, normalize text, and handle common text-related issues.
